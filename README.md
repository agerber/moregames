## Video games!
See _instructions.txt files in the /src subdirectories of asteriods, mario, joust, pacman, missile, and sinistar.

To run the games, right click the Game.java files in the mvc/controller/ dirs.

To use sinistar, joust, or mario as your base, delete the asteroids code in your proJava project and then
 drag and drop (to move) the mario or sinistar directories into your proJava project. IntelliJ will 
 automatically refactor the packages. Test the Game.java file by running it from your proJava. Right-click the new mario or 
 sinistar dir, select git | add files to git, then commit and push. Continue to modify the source code.
 
Added two older games: pacman and missile command. Some of the code in these projects is not completely thread-safe. Be
careful if you borrow code from these projects.

HALL OF FAME:
Mike Vasiliou - Sinistar
Taylor Piske - Joust
John Moison - Mario Brothers
Robert Timpone - Missile Command
Patrick Niels - PacMan
