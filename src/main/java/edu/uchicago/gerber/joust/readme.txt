| BALLOON FIGHT |

Balloon Fight is based on the classic Nintendo Entertainment System game from 1986 of the same name (that apparently nobody's heard of).
You play as Balloon Kid, trying to clear the sky of Balloon Foxes. When a Balloon Fox has inflated his balloon and is airborne,
he's in attack mode and can pop your balloon. Without a balloon, you'll fall to your death. But when a Balloon Fox is grounded
or if he's parachuting to earth after you've popped his balloons, he's completely defenseless. Go knock him off the map!

Pop bubbles for extra points, evade loosed bolts of lightning, and be wary of what lurks beneath the sea...
Midway through your campaign, a bonus level will challenge you to pop every balloon floating out of some
quite mysterious pipes. Pop them all and get a 1-UP. You may need it.
Have fun and good luck, p1.
